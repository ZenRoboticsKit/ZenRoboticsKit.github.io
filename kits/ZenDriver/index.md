# Getting Started

The zen driver was designed to be used with an ESP32-Devkitc V4 module. It should be used with the following Arduino library.
If you are in 1001 please see course instructions here.

# SAMD51 and Feather support

The board is capable of recieving Feather compatible boards, Currently the ESP32-Thing-Plus has been tested and is a drop-in replacment for the Devkitc.
We have tested the board with some other feather modules, Please see the list here.

# Module Pinout
